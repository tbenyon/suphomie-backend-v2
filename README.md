# suphomie-backend-v2
A fresh look at a home automation app

# Setup
To install dependencies, the app will require you to run:
```bash
npm install
```
_____

You will require an app created on[Pusher][1].

There is an example config file in the route of the project:
> config.example.json

This will need to be duplicated and updated with your own app details. The new file should be called:
> config.json
